## Validation of the installation package
Downloaded the msi installer for MongoDB. Then created a text file were I added the SHA-256 checksum to the file and gave the file a approprioate name as instructed in the tutorial to verify mongodb packages. Opened up Powershell in the directy containing both the installer and the file containing the SHA-256 checksum, and then verified the package using a script from the tutorial. The result in the screenshot below.
