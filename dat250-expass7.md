# Report on Software Technology Experiment Assignment 6
## Technical Problems

- Did not figure out to run the tutorial in the console. Did however manage to run multiple main classes with intellij run configuration with necessary arguments.
- Attempted to change the gradle configuration in "build.gradle.kts" file to dynamically pass the main class without success.

## Link to code

## Pending issues
Did not figure out how to run the java files in the console, e.g. multiple workers.

## Summary
Through this tutorial, I learned how to use RabbitMQ to send and receive messages in Java using the rabbitMQ client. I also learned the basics of work queues and Publish/Subscribe.
